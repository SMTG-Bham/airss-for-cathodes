This is the repository containins the raw research data for *Accelerating Cathode Material Discovery through Ab Initio Random Structure Searching*

Because of the amount of data involved, this repository only includes analysis files and key structures. 

## Folder structure

- `aiida_export` contains the archive file exported from the [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net) framework, which is was used for performing most of the DFT calculations (Available here: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/11.5281/zenodo.5725660.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5725660)).
- `data` contains tabulated data in csv format used for making some plots.
- `notebooks` continas notebooks associated with data analysis used in each section of the manuscript. (Certain in house codes loaded by these notebooks are not included in this repo.)
- `paper_asserts` contains the figures used for the manuscript as well as some structural files (VESTA).
- `search_data` contains the strucutres generated by the search.
- `structures` contains the key structure files.
