# Data associated with *Accelerating Cathode Material Discovery through Ab Initio Random Structure Searching*

This is the repository containins the raw research data for *Accelerating Cathode Material Discovery through Ab Initio Random Structure Searching*

Because the amount of data involved, this repository will have two different version. One is version controlled containing analysis files and key structures, the other contains larger files such as raw calculation outputs and the AiiDA export archive.

## Folder structure

- `aiida_export` contains the archive file exported from the [AiiDA](www.aiida.net) database used for performing most of the DFT calculations (Only avalaible in the extras repository: DOI:XXX).  
- `data` contains tabulated data in csv format used for making some plots.
- `notebooks` continas notebooks associated with data analysis used in each section of the manuscript. (Certain in house codes loaded by these notebooks are not included in this repo.)
- `paper_asserts` contains the figures used for the manuscript as well as some structural files (VESTA).
- `search_data` contains the strucutres generated by the search.
- `structures` contains the key structure files.
